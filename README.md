**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**:   
Check Real Time Live NBA scores and betting odds

**AS AN NBA ENTHUSIAST…**
	…I WANT to see a minimal collection of all the NBA games and betting odds for every
game each night…

…SO THAT I can make an educated choice about potential bets.

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**
WHEN I want game information,

GIVEN I click on a game scoreboard,

THEN each frame will display line-ups, standings, live scores, and betting odds

**APIS USED:** 
API-Sports (Api-Basketball) + GIPHY

**BREAKDOWN:**  
A live scoreboard of all games of current date - when a specific game is clicked on, it opens in greater detail specifics about that game including betting odds and lineups.  Also, a pretty neat random gif relating to the teams playing will show up.
